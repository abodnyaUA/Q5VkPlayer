Q5VkPlayer
==========

Hello, here is my new version of QVkPlayer.
It's a player for your Vkontakte music playlist. It inspired by elementary style.
And i desiged it to be simple and easy to use.



It's now based on qt5, so packege size is incresed, but for now it can play 
any song from your Vk playlist.

Current version is 0.1a it can:
1.Login to your vk accaunt;
2.load your playlist
3.Play song by double ckick
4.play random song
5.Search in current playlist
6.Volume slider in right bottom corner

You can get an package from here:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49831443/QVkPlayer.zip
Just unzip folder wherever you want and run QVkPlayer.exe;
It stored your settings in windows registry, so you needn't to login everytime.
And now after update it would save your settings. 

Bugreport, please, and have a nice day;)
